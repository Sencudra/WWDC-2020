I dedicate this playground to eye health in the 21st century (#yearofvision2020). Considering that we spent the last couple of months at home (I've been studying and working remotely from March 17) and spend even more time using our devices (iPhones, iMacs, etc.), this topic is more relevant than ever. Even 2020 is considered the year of vision as it combines the symbol of ideal vision "20/20". All other details on the topic are in the playground, have fun :)
